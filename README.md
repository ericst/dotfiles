# ericst's dotfiles

## Introduction

Those are my dotfiles. 
They are managed using Ruby scripts.
It was inspired by http://troydm.github.io/blog/2017/02/27/manage-your-dotfiles-like-a-boss/ and https://github.com/troydm/central.
But instead of having to install a gem I wanted a local script for it.
It is also a lot easier for the moment.
For more informations:

```
    ./dotfiles.rb -h

```
