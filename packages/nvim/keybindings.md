# Keybindings

As the keybindings are defined a little bit all over the place this file
centralize them for me.

- `9` -> Switch to ~/journal.md buffer

### Under `<leader>w` 

#### Working with Window/Panes
- `h` -> Create horizontal split

- `o` -> Keep only this pane open
- `c` -> Close this window
