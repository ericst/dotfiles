# Keybindings

As the keybindings are defined a little bit all over the place this file
centralize them for me.

## Normal mode
- `,` -> Repeat last : command
- `n` -> Next search result (centered)
- `N` -> Previous search result (centered)
- `<C-d>` -> Half page down (centered)
- `<C-u>` -> Half page up (centered)
- `<A-j>` -> Move line down
- `<A-k>` -> Move line up

## Visual mode
- `<` -> Indent left and reselect
- `>` -> Indent right and reselect
- `<A-j>` -> Move selection down
- `<A-k>` -> Move selection up

## Under `<leader>`

### Buffer management (`<leader>b`)
- `n` -> Next buffer
- `p` -> Previous buffer
- `b` -> List buffers (interactive)
- `s` -> Open the *scratch* buffer
- `j` -> Open global journal (~/journal.md)

### Window management (`<leader>w`)
- `s` -> Create horizontal split
- `v` -> Create vertical split
- `o` -> Keep only this window
- `c` -> Close this window
- `h` -> Move to left window
- `j` -> Move to bottom window
- `k` -> Move to top window
- `l` -> Move to right window
