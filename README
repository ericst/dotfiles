1 Introduction
==============

  Those are my dotfiles. They are supplied in the form of literate Emacs
  org-mode.

  One way of installing them is to open the desired file and run
  `org-babel-tangle-file' on them. However, a small script `tangle.sh'
  is provided for convenience. You can therefore use it as is:

  ,----
  | source tangle.sh <file-to-tangle>
  `----


2 The configurations
====================

  The following are my configuration files. You can activate them by
  either opening them in emacs an running `org-babel-tangle-file' (`C-c
  C-v t') or, as explained in the introduction, by using the `tangle.sh'
  script.

  [Emacs.org]
        My emacs configuration.


[Emacs.org] <file:Emacs.org>


3 Tangle Script
===============

  The tangle script is provided as a script to be sourced because I
  sometimes will execute on GNU guix installations. It is therefore
  difficult to know in advance where bash will be located for the
  shebang.

  ,----
  | echo "Running org-babel-tangle-file on $1"
  | emacs --batch \
  |       --eval "(require 'org)" \
  |       --eval "(org-babel-tangle-file \"$1\")"
  `----
