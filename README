1 Introduction
══════════════

  Those are my dotfiles. They are supplied in the form of literate Emacs
  org-mode. The different configuration are therefore easy to follow,
  update and kept in a documented way.

  One way of installing them is to open the desired file and run
  `org-babel-tangle-file' on them. However, a small script `tangle.sh'
  is provided for convenience. You can therefore use it as is:

  ┌────
  │ source tangle.sh <file-to-tangle>
  └────

  The tangle script is provided as a script to be sourced because I
  sometimes will execute on GNU guix installations. It is therefore
  difficult to know in advance where bash will be located for the
  shebang. Here is the script.

  ┌────
  │ echo "Running org-babel-tangle-file on $1"
  │ \emacs --batch \
  │       --eval "(require 'org)" \
  │       --eval "(org-babel-tangle-file \"$1\")"
  └────

  It is worth noting, that each org-mode file can be tangled into
  several different files.


1.1 Migration to stow
─────────────────────

  In the end, it is maybe easier to use stow. I am migrating the
  explanation files to sub-folders that can be installed with stow.

  Once this is finished, the way to install it will be with:

  ┌────
  │ stow --no-folding  $package
  └────

  Using the –no-folding option ensures that I only link the files, no
  folders. That way the git repository stays clean.


2 Tools
═══════

  I keep one general file per tool. This file describe then the intended
  configuration and can directly be tangled as the configuration if need
  be.

  You will find those files in the *tools* sub-directory.

  [Emacs.org]
        My Emacs configuration.
  [Bash.org]
        My Bash configuration.
  [Readline.org]
        My Readline configuration.
  [Git.org]
        My Git configuration.


[Emacs.org] <file:tools/Emacs.org>

[Bash.org] <file:tools/Bash.org>

[Readline.org] <file:tools/Readline.org>

[Git.org] <file:tools/Git.org>


3 Machines
══════════

  I also keep a configuration for each separate machine I use
  (e.g. Laptop, Desktop or Work Computer). This file serves to describe
  and set different machines' specificity (alternate directory paths,
  idiosyncrasy due to the specific OS.)

  You will find those files in the *machines* sub-directory.
