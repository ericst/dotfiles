# Eric Seuret's Dot Files

These are my config files to configure a machine the way I like it.

Feel free to take inspirations ;-)

## Installation

Installation is perforemed by invokit the install.py script:

  ./install.py

It will then create symbolic link pointing to the files in this directory. 
The files will have the same name as the files in this directory with a 
leading dot.

There is an option to force the install,

  ./install.py -f

This will delete any file in place and create the desired symlinks.
