These are my config files to configure a machine the way I like it.

Feel free to take inspirations ;-)

== Installation
For simplicity, everything is managed by https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm[RCM].
So just follow their guide to understand.

=== Spacemacs
http://spacemacs.org/[Spacemacs] will assume that you have it extracted in ~/.emacs.d so don't forget to install it:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
----
