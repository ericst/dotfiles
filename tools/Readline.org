#+TITLE: Readline Configuration

* Introduction
Readline configuration affects a lot of programs using it.

* Bell
I don't like my computer beeping, I would rather prefer a visual feedback, as it
is more discreet.

#+begin_src fundamental :tangle ~/.inputrc
  set bell-style visible
#+end_src

* Completion
Readline is responsible for the interactive parts of the tab completion. Here
are the settings that make for a nice experience.

- ~completion-ignore-case~ :: Perform completions in a case-insensitive way.

- ~completion-map-case~ :: Treat '-' as equivalent to '_' when looking for
  completion matches. This simplify the typing.

- ~match-hidden-files~ :: Makes completion work on hidden files without having
  to supply the . character.

- ~show-all-if-ambiguous~ :: Show immediately possible completions. I don't want
  to press Tab two-times.

#+begin_src fundamental :tangle ~/.inputrc
set completion-ignore-case on
set completion-map-case on
set match-hidden-files on
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
#+end_src
